# There are many ways to run this setup script on device. Here are some methods:

* `setupTermuxPRoot.sh` can be installed by tapping [this link](https://sdrausty.github.io/TermuxPRoot/setupTermuxPRoot.sh) which should download `setupTermuxPRoot.sh` into your `/sdcard/Download/` directory on your smartphone and tablet.  Then execute this script by running:

```  

* Copying and pasting the following command lines into your Termux command shell is another way to get Linux on device. Hint, copy and paste the following:

pkg install wget
wget https://sdrausty.github.io/TermuxPRoot/setupTermuxPRoot.sh

```

* Run the following command lines to install Linux in Termux on your device. Hint, copy and paste the following into the Termux window: 

```
pkg install git
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/sdrausty/TermuxPRoot
